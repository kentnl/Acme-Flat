Acme::Flat

This module is mostly a learning experiment to help me understand the
mechanics behind perl's "B" internals, and hopefully making more
friendly documentation for "B" components in the process.

At present, it only contains the implemented hierarchy present in
">5.18", with no more than stub classes to represent each "OP", each
with descriptions.

But it is hoped alone that having a description for each "OP" gives some
improvement on its own.
